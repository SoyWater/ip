# AI USE IN PROJECT
This project utilizes AI technologies to enhance various functionalities and improve user experience. Below are some of the key areas where AI is implemented:

1. Automatic Documentation Generation
   - Intellij AI is used to automatically generate and update project documentation based on code changes.
   - AI generates summaries and descriptions for each method and class.

2. Test Case Generation
   - GPT 4.0 is employed to create comprehensive test cases that cover various scenarios and edge cases.
   - This helps in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the code.
   - Prompt used:
        ```
        For all of the following code, generate test cases using JUnit that cover all edge cases and some basic scenarios
        Follow the naming convention of testMethodName_scenario_expectedBehavior for each test case
        ```
