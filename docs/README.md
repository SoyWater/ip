## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure Java 17 is Installed
Shadow requires Java 17 or higher. To check your Java version, open your terminal and run:
```
java -version
```
You should see output similar to:
```
java version "17.0.x"
```
If you do not have Java 17 installed, download it from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### 2. Install the JAR file
Download the latest `shadow.jar` from the [Releases]() page of the GitHub repository.

### 3. Run the Packaged JAR File
Navigate to the directory containing `shadow.jar`:

On linux or macOS:
```
cd ~/Downloads
```
Run Shadow using:
```
java -jar shadow.jar
```
You will be greeted with a prompt to enter commands.

If you see an error about Java version, ensure you are using Java 17 or higher.
