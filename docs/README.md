## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure Java 17 is Installed
Shadow requires Java 17 or higher. To check your Java version, open your terminal and run:
```
java -version
```
You should see output similar to:
```
java version "17.0.x"
```
If you do not have Java 17 installed, download it from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### 2. Install the JAR file
Download the latest `shadow.jar` from the [Releases]() page of the GitHub repository.

### 3. Run the Packaged JAR File
Navigate to the directory containing `shadow.jar`:

On linux or macOS:
```
cd ~/Downloads
```
Run Shadow using:
```
java -jar shadow.jar
```
You will be greeted with a prompt to enter commands.

If you see an error about Java version, ensure you are using Java 17 or higher.

## Error Handling

If you enter an invalid command, Shadow will show a helpful error message with usage instructions.

## Data Storage and File Management

Shadow stores your tasks in a JSON file for persistence between sessions.

### Default Data File Location
By default, your tasks are saved in:
```
~/.shadowData/tasks.json
```
This is a hidden folder in your home directory.

### Changing the Data File Location
You can temporarily change the data file route for the current session using:
```
source <file path>
```
- Example: `source /path/to/your/custom_tasks.json`
- To revert to the default file, use: `source default`

### Editing the Data File Manually
The data file is in JSON format. If you plan to edit it manually:
- **Backup the file first!**
- Only advanced users should attempt manual edits.
- You must follow the JSON format exactly, or Shadow may fail to load your tasks or corrupt your data.
- After editing, restart Shadow to reload your changes.

**Warning:** Manual editing is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. Incorrect edits may result in data loss or application errors.
